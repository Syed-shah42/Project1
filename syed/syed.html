          <p>
            Hi, My name is Syed Shah. I am majoring in
            computer science B.S. This is my second last semester.
            I plan to start working right after I graduate. My hobbies
            are working out, playing basketball and video games. I am 
            familiar with two programming languages, C++ and Java.
          </p>

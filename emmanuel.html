          <p>
              Hey my name is Emmanuel Nnaji and i am a CS major at here at lehman college.
              I enjoy reading manga, watching anime, drawing and spending time with friends and family.
              I also enjoy watching basketball and my favorite player of all time is Kobe Bryant, arguably
              the greatest to ever do it besides M.J.
